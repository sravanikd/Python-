- Casting one number to be float: float(3)/2; = 1.5 float(3) = 3.0;

-The //  operator (two forward-slashes) performs "floor division" and truncates the decimal without rounding.

# module for python 2 to import modules from python 3

from __future__ import division

# Finding power

2 to the power of 3 == 2**3;

# Order of operation is followed in this..

# Assigning labels to objects

- using equal sign: a=5; if we call a,it'll output 5

##Rules to create labels: 
1. Names can not start with a number.
2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
3. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that the names are lowercase.

Using variable names can be a very useful way to keep track of different variables in Python. For example:

-Use object names to keep better track of what's going on in your code!
my_income = 100

tax_rate = 0.1

my_taxes = my_income*tax_rate

-Show my taxes!
my_taxes
Out[46]:
10.0
