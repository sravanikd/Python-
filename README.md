# Python

To open Python and run code:

1st way: In Anaconda cmd prompt, type "python" & start writing code
         To quit, type " quit() " and hit enter.
         
2nd way: Long code --> Text editor --> write code --> save it in Anaconda folder with  .py extension
         In cmd,type " python file_name.py "
        
3rd way: IDEs, specific text editors for Python:
         WINGWARE, KOMODO, PyCharm, Spyder, Jupyter
         
         In Jupyter: -> Open Jupyter notebook (type " jupyter notebook" in anaconda cmd)
                     -> Create new python file and rename it as you wish.
                     
            Points for jupyter notes usage:
                      1) "shift+enter" will run a cell
                      2) "Tab" will show a pop up of methods on an object.
                      3) "Shift+Tab" will show pop up for doc string.
                      4)  Types of cells: "markdown" cell shows text 
                      5) # one line comment & ''' ''' for multi line comment
                      6) to see current working directory. type 'pwd' (print working directory' and run the cell.
